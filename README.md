# MovieTime
Video player for group remote movie watching

MovieTime v0.1.0 is a very nice looking media player for Windows. The difference and innovation about it is that the player creates an HTTP web server and streams the played video to anybody that has the appropriate URL address to it. supports subtitles and streams it to the spectators too. all the spectators, including the host have the ability to play/pause and change the position of the video. The player also provides a chat with notifications, customizable avatars and spectators names.

# How to use it?
The app is portable (don’t need installation), just click and run.
In the left top corner of the player is located the settings icon. The two ports are the ports that you’ll have to set in to your router’s port-forwarding and if you have a firewall, you’ll have to allow the app to use the internet. The link in the right top corner “Copy share link” is the place where you’re gonna receive the link that you’ll have to share with your friends. The supported video files are “MP4”, “AVI”, “MKV” and “SRT” for subtitles. If the video file is not “MP4” the player will engage a file conversion protocol (because the spectators environment is web browser and the supported format is mp4) and when the file is converted, it will join the rest of the video files in the playlist. The video stream is very secure and by my opinion, untraceable. I also didn’t add anything that exposes your privacy.

I wish you happy watching with friends :)))
